## Hey guys üëã

My name is Georg, a front-end developer with over 6 years of experience, graduated in Systems Analysis from the Assis Municipal Educational Foundation.<br/>

I'm currently part of the front-end team at a startup, where I'm involved in challenging and innovative projects. One of these projects is the development of a platform that connects real estate experts, and we recently managed to successfully launch the first version. In addition, I'm collaborating on the initial structuring of an innovative fintech project for the real estate market.<br/>

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on several projects in sectors such as agriculture, innovation hub, advertising, education, healthcare, and real estate. This experience has given me a comprehensive view of the different needs of clients, making me a versatile and adaptable professional.<br/>

I specialize in various front-end technologies, such as React, Next.js, Redux, Hooks, JavaScript, TypeScript, Styled Components, Zero-runtime CSS-in-JS libraries, Storybook, RESTful APIs, Jest, Docker, and Jira. Additionally, I have experience with agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, and I contribute to the development and management of CI/CD tools, ensuring quality in pipelines and builds.<br/>

Outside of my professional work, I created a low-cost, open-source IoT prototype for smart agriculture for weather monitoring.<br/>
